 * orders wrong the moment a schema 1.10 exists, because 1.10 < 1.6, and a
 * marker tied to the app version cannot move when the shape of the file moves
 * without the app moving with it. The stored marker is now `schemaVersion`, an
 * integer, and it counts schemas and nothing else.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: a document in, a document out, no file system, no
 * Electron, no logging. The host reads the JSON, runs it through
 * {@link migrateConfigDocument}, then hands the result to `normalizeConfig`,
 * which stays the last line of defense. That order matters. Migrations move
 * shape between known schemas; the normalizer clamps every field whatever the
 * schema turned out to be. Neither one throws, so a config file can be as
 * strange as it likes and the launcher still starts.
