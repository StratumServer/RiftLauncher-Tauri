/**
 * The two size questions a backup has to answer before anything is written.

 * ahead and, when it cannot, in what sentence.
 *
 * The sentences are the ones the player ends up reading (#345), so they name

 * the launcher compressing a folder the player already has on their own disk,
 * and 64 GiB is several times the largest installation anyone has reported, so
 * it is a bound rather than no bound at all. It also keeps the promise the
